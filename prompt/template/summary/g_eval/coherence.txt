You will be given a summary of a single email.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - The summary should be well-structured and well-organized. Each sentence should contribute to a logical flow of information. The summary should not read like a scattered collection of points but should present a clear and cohesive representation of the original email.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Understand the Context
- Read the original email carefully and identify the main points.
- Read the summary and compare it to the original email.

2. Check Structure & Clarity
- Are the key ideas presented in a logical order?
- Does the summary read smoothly, or does it feel fragmented?
- Is the language coherent and consistent throughout?

3. Assign a Coherence Score (1–5):
- 1: The summary is very disjointed, hard to follow, and lacks a clear structure. It feels like an unorganized collection of sentences with no logical connection.
- 2: The summary attempts to capture the email’s content but remains difficult to follow. Ideas are presented in a somewhat random order, making it unclear how they relate to each other.
- 3: The summary has some logical structure, but there are noticeable jumps between ideas. The connections between points are weak, making it slightly difficult to read.
- 4: The summary is mostly well-organized with a clear flow of information. Some minor inconsistencies or abrupt transitions may exist but do not significantly affect readability.
- 5: The summary is highly coherent, well-structured, and reads as a unified text. All ideas are logically connected, and the content flows smoothly from one part to the next.
