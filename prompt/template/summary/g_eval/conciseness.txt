You will be given a single email. 

Your job is to create a concise summary that highlights the email’s main objective, key requests, and any critical dates or times. 

Keep it clear, brief, and focused on essential information, excluding unnecessary details.


Evaluation Criteria:

Conciseness (1-5): Focus exclusively on the summary’s length, clarity, and avoidance of unnecessary details.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Check for Redundancies & Clarity
- Ensure there is no repetitive or irrelevant information.
- Confirm the text remains understandable without additional context or elaboration.

2. Evaluate Formatting Requirements
- Nominal Ending: The summary must end in a noun form.
- Comma Separation: Key ideas (as presented) should be separated by commas for easy readability.
- 165-Character Limit: Verify that the entire summary, including spaces, is at or below 165 characters.

3. Assign a Conciseness Score (1–5)
- 1: Fails to meet any formatting requirements (no noun ending, no comma separation, exceeds 165 characters).
- 2: Partially meets only one requirement; includes notable redundancy or unclear sections.
- 3: Fully meets one requirement and partially meets another; overall somewhat concise but could be further refined.
- 4: Meets two requirements with minimal unnecessary content.
- 5: Perfectly meets all three requirements (nominal ending, comma separation, 165-character limit) and is clear, focused, and free of superfluous detail.
