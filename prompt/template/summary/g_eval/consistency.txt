You will be given a summary of a single email.

Your task is to rate the summary on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.


Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - The summary should be factually aligned with the original email. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are supported by the source email and does not introduce new, misleading, or incorrect information. Summaries that contain hallucinated facts (i.e., information not found in the original email) should be penalized.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the Email Carefully
- Identify the main facts, key details, and overall message of the email.

2. Compare the Summary to the Email
- Does the summary accurately reflect the key points of the email?
- Does it introduce any information that is not supported by the email?
- Are there any factual distortions, exaggerations, or omissions?

3. Assign a Consistency Score (1â€“5):
- 1: The summary is highly inconsistent with the email. It contains multiple incorrect or hallucinated facts, misrepresents the key points, or significantly alters the intended message.
- 2: The summary has notable factual inconsistencies. Some information is misrepresented or missing, making it unreliable.
- 3: The summary is mostly consistent but contains at least one minor factual error or omission that slightly distorts the original meaning.
- 4: The summary is largely accurate and aligns well with the email. There may be very minor rewording or omission, but they do not significantly affect the meaning.
- 5: The summary is fully consistent with the email. It accurately reflects all key points without adding, removing, or distorting any factual information.
