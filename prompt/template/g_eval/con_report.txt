You will be given a daily report that was compiled from multiple email summaries.

Your task is to rate the report on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer back to them as needed during your review.

Evaluation Criteria:

Consistency (1-5) - The report must accurately reflect the factual content presented in the original emails. Any statements in the report should be supported by at least one email’s content; no invented or contradictory information should appear. A factually consistent report does not introduce details that are contradicted by or absent from the original emails. A score of 1 indicates the report is highly inconsistent (contains significant factual errors or hallucinated details), while a score of 5 indicates the report is entirely aligned with the source emails.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the Source Emails
- Identify the main facts, data points, and important details from the original emails.

2. Examine the Daily Report
- Compare each statement in the report to the information in the emails.
- Check for any “hallucinated” (fabricated) facts or contradictions.
- Note any critical details in the emails that are misrepresented or incorrectly omitted.

3. Assign a Consistency Score (1–5)
- 1: The report contains many factual errors or contradictions.
- 2–3: The report is partially consistent but has notable factual issues.
- 4: The report is mostly accurate with minor discrepancies.
- 5: The report is fully accurate and contains no evident contradictions.
