You will be given a daily report that was compiled from multiple email summaries.

Your task is to rate the report on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer back to them as needed during your review.


Evaluation Criteria:

Fluency (1-3): The quality of the report in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. Format is also considered as well. The report should never use bullet point format. For example, it should not be like "1. example_sentence_1 2. example_sentence_2".

- 1: Poor – The report has multiple errors or awkward phrasing that make it hard to understand or sound unnatural.
- 2: Fair – The report has some minor errors that affect clarity or smoothness, but the main points remain comprehensible.
- 3: Good – The report has few or no errors and is easy to read and follow.
