Relevance (1-5) - The report should contain the most important content from the original emails. Irrelevant or redundant information should be minimized. A higher score indicates the report effectively captures the key points without unnecessary details.
Coherence (1-5) - The report should be well-structured and well-organized. Each section or paragraph should flow logically from one to the next. The report should not read like a disjointed set of statements copied from separate emails, but rather form a coherent narrative or overview of the day’s content. A score of 1 indicates very poor coherence (confusing or disjointed); a score of 5 indicates excellent coherence (clear, logical flow). The longer the report, the smaller the number should be. The report must be around 3 sentences. Any report longer than 3 sentences is strongly penalized.
Consistency (1-5) - The report must accurately reflect the factual content presented in the original emails. Any statements in the report should be supported by at least one email’s content; no invented or contradictory information should appear. A factually consistent report does not introduce details that are contradicted by or absent from the original emails. A score of 1 indicates the report is highly inconsistent (contains significant factual errors or hallucinated details), while a score of 5 indicates the report is entirely aligned with the source emails.
Fluency (1-3): The quality of the report in terms of grammar, spelling, punctuation, word choice, and sentence structure. Format is also considered as well. The report should never use bullet point format. For example, it should not be like "1. example_sentence_1 2. example_sentence_2".
