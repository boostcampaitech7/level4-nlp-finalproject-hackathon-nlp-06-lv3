You will be given a daily report that was compiled from multiple email summaries.

Your task is to rate the report on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer back to them as needed during your review.

Evaluation Criteria:

Relevance (1-5) - The report should contain the most important content from the original emails. Irrelevant or redundant information should be minimized. A higher score indicates the report effectively captures the key points without unnecessary details.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Read the Source Emails
- Identify the main points, essential data, and key takeaways from the emails.

2. Examine the Daily Report
- Check if the report includes the most important or critical points from each email.
- Note any redundant or unimportant details that dilute the main message.

3. Assess Overall Coverage vs. Relevance
- Is the report overly lengthy with minor, unnecessary facts?
- Does it miss any major points that appear in the emails?

4. Assign a Relevance Score (1–5)
- 1: The report is largely off-topic or misses most key points.
- 2–3: The report includes some relevant info, but also has noticeable irrelevant content or omissions.
- 4: The report covers most important points with minimal redundancy.
- 5: The report is highly focused, capturing nearly all key points and avoiding unnecessary detail.
