You will be given a daily report that was compiled from multiple email summaries.

Your task is to rate the report on one metric.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Refer back to them as needed during your review.

Evaluation Criteria:

Coherence (1-5) - The report should be well-structured and well-organized. Each section or paragraph should flow logically from one to the next. The report should not read like a disjointed set of statements copied from separate emails, but rather form a coherent narrative or overview of the day’s content. A score of 1 indicates very poor coherence (confusing or disjointed); a score of 5 indicates excellent coherence (clear, logical flow). The longer the report, the lower the number should be. The report must be around 3 sentences.

Evaluation Steps:

1. Understand the Context
- Read the given daily report carefully. Recognize that this report is supposed to consolidate multiple email summaries into a single cohesive and condensed overview or “daily update.”

2. Check Structure & Clarity
- Are the ideas presented in a logical order?
- Does each part naturally flow into the next, or does it feel like a random list of points?
- Is the language coherent and consistent throughout?
- Is the report short enough? The report must be around 3 sentences for this task; any report longer than 3 sentences must be strongly penalized. 

3. Assign a Coherence Score (1–5)
- 1: The report is very disjointed, hard to follow.
- 2–3: The report partially organizes the content but still jumps around.
- 4: The report has mostly logical flow with minor issues.
- 5: The report is highly coherent and reads as a well-structured, well-condensed, unified summary, short.
